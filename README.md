7. To remove and clean all images

```bash
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans --rmi all
```

# Development

## Getting Started

1. npm install

```sh
npm install
```

2. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

# Note for Future Improvements

### Performance:

1. Database indexing for full text search
2. Event Driven approach to keep all tabs in Sync
3. Limit the number of API calls - merge states on client-side. Right now, each CRUD operation performs 2 API calls (one
   for the operation
   and other one to load the todo list).
4. Impl `useOptimistic(...)` to improve the loading time.

### Maintainability:

1. Add Unit and E2E Tests
2. Refactoring to improve DRY and readability

### Error Handling

1. Improve error handling and UI/UX error messages

### Authentication

1. The current authentication is handled via cookies on the server-side, which works well for demo purposes but isn't
   ideal for production. Implement OAuth and social logins for Authentication.
